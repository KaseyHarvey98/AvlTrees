The files AvlTree.h, AvlTree.cpp, and  dsexceptions.h can be used 
in your programs. Just attribute the code to Mark Allen  Weiss in your 
program.
 cannot get avl tree to work , so i created other variables to act in place of tree
tree_collection constructor would not work
 can't access no member functions of Avl
didnt know how to traverse/search through avl tree given that i was unable to use it's members

i honestly thought i understood this project but clearly i needed way more help than i thought
